# WolfAuth Version 2.0

The first version of WolfAuth while somewhat functional, it was perhaps a little TOO ambitious. WolfAuth 2.0 still offers powerful auth functionality, but without complicating things or relying on third party libraries.

## Documentation?
Proper documentation will be coming shortly (it's in the works). Right now you'll have to dig into the source code cowboy and don't worry, it's commented pretty well.
